        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my portfolio! I’m a statistical programming placement student at UCB, where I contribute to clinical research by creating tools that improve how results are shared and understood. 
          Working in the highly regulated pharmaceutical environment, I’ve gained practical experience with statistical reporting and stakeholder-focused deliverables.
        </p>

        <p></p>
          One area I’ve especially focused on is building Shiny applications, both internally and in personal projects. These apps make data 
          interactive and easier to explore, combining technical depth with real world usability. I’m also exploring machine learning use cases 
          and model deployment through Shiny, which has strengthened both my programming skills and product-thinking mindset.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ll return to the University of Reading in September 2025 to complete my mathematics degree, where I’ve received the Departmental Achievement Award
          in both first and second year for my academic performance, placing in the top 4 of my cohort in both years.
